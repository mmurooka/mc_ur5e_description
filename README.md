# UR5e robot description for [mc_rtc](https://jrl-umi3218.github.io/mc_rtc/)
This package has additional convex files for mc_ur5e robot module used by [mc_rtc](https://jrl-umi3218.github.io/mc_rtc/) control framework.
UR5e robot has urdf, collada and meshes in the original [ur_description](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/tree/melodic-devel/ur_description) package.

It contains the following directories:
- `convex/`: convex hulls (generated from pointclouds sampled from the dae meshes)
- `rsdf/`: Special urdf-like format describing surfaces attached to links on the robot (The folder is empty)

## Required dependencies
- [ur_description](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/tree/melodic-devel/ur_description)

## Installation

On an environment with ROS and catkin properly setup:

```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot
$ git clone https://github.com/isri-aist/mc_ur5e_description
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```

If you install into a different directory than the src directory of the catkin workspace, run the following commands.
```
$ cd build
$ make install
```
If your catkin environment is sourced `source ~/catkin_ws/install/setup.bash`, the robot model will be available to all ROS tools, and mc_rtc robot module.

To display the robot, you can use:
```
$ roslaunch mc_ur5e_description display_ur5e.launch
```

- If you have mc_rtc and the corresponding robot module installed, you can use the `convexes:=True` or `surfaces:=True` arguments to display the robot convexes and surfaces.

## When updating convex files

### Dependencies
- [ur_description](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/tree/melodic-devel/ur_description)
- [mesh_sampling](https://github.com/arntanguy/mesh_sampling)
- qhull-bin

### Generation of convex files
To run the conversion, simply run

```
$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
$ roscd mc_ur5e_description/scripts
$ ./generate_convex.sh
  Running generate_convex.sh script from directory <MC_UR5E_DESCRIPTION_PATH>/script
